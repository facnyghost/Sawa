# Sawa
Sawa is Ionic cross platform application similar to Ubber and Careem
with additional features and additional functions.

The main idea of â€‹the project is to share the ride with other people
fromdifferent locations and reach different places in a certain area.

Sawa was built using Ionic V4 with object-oriented
design,Node.JS/Express and AngularJS as well as
JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 andApache Cordova.
An algorithm was designed to calculate the drivers' fare depending onthe
distance covered by the car for each customer.
Used AI for area and zone creation.Almost used all Google map's
function's such as (current location, livedriver location, etc..).Stored data
on Firebase and Firestore.
